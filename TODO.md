- [ ] Ensure Ansible Idempotency
- [x] `audit.rules` check if content is the same instead of overwriting every single time
- [x] review `changed_when` usage
- [x] try to use `ansible.builtin.assert` where possible?
- [ ] use molecule to do testing
- [ ] review tasks that do checks (change the wording? how to determine the Ansible state (ok, changed, failed)?)
